# GitHub contributions style message generator

This is a simple html page that generates a message in a style of GitHub contributions grid.
You can use it to create an image for your social profiles or your CV, etc.

![Welcome example](images/contribution-grid-welcome.png)

[Try it on github.artem.work](https://github.artem.work)

I used [html-to-image](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image/) script to generate the images from html page.

## Usage

There is no build step, just open `index.html` in your browser and you are ready to go.
